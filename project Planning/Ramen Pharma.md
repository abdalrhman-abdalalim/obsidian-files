# **Project Retrospective & Self-Review**

## **1. Project Summary**

**Alhamdulillah**, the project was completed **successfully before the deadline**. The UI turned out well, and the overall structure was simple, but **planning could have been better from the start**.

## **2. What Went Well (Positives)** ✅

- **UI/UX**: The interface was clean and functional. (**Alhamdulillah**)
    
- **Code Quality**: The code was **clean and well-structured**, though rushed at the end.
    
- **React Query**: Used effectively for data fetching. (**Alhamdulillah**)
    
- **Timely Delivery**: Finished **ahead of schedule** despite challenges.
    

## **3. Challenges & Pain Points** ❌

- **Poor Initial Planning**: No clear roadmap at the beginning.
    
- **Rushed Final Phase**: Focused more on finishing than refining.
    
- **Build Issues**: Faced repeated problems with **static generation** in Next.js.
    
- **Dynamic Routes**: Caused unexpected **build errors**.
    
- **Testing Gaps**: Discovered late that many edge cases needed testing.
    
- **Time Pressure**: The biggest challenge was **working under tight deadlines**, leading to rushed decisions.
    

## **4. Key Lessons Learned** 📖

- **Better Planning**: Next time, use **Agile** (sprints, backlog) for structured workflow.
    
- **Static Generation**: Must learn **`generateStaticParams` & `generateStaticPaths`** to avoid build issues.
    
- **Testing Early**: Implement **automated testing** from the start to catch issues sooner.
    
- **Avoid Overengineering**: If the project is simple, **stick to React** instead of Next.js (since some features weren’t utilized).
    

## **5. Action Plan for Next Project** 🚀

|**Improvement Area**|**Action Steps**|
|---|---|
|**Planning**|Use **Agile methodology** (backlog, sprints, daily standups).|
|**Static Generation**|Learn **`generateStaticParams` & `generateStaticPaths`** to fix build errors.|
|**Testing**|Write **unit/integration tests early**, not at the end.|
|**Tech Stack**|If the project is simple, consider **React instead of Next.js**.|
|**Dynamic Routes**|Debug and optimize dynamic routes before final build.|

### **Final Thoughts**

**Alhamdulillah** for completing the project, but **better planning and deeper Next.js knowledge** will prevent future issues. Next time: **Agile, testing, and proper static generation** will be prioritized.
