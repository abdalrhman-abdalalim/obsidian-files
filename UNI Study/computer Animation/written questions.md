### Elements of multimedia : 
- audio - graphics - image - video - animation 
- traditional media (text- graphics)
### Categories of multimedia :
- linear : content without any navigation 
- non linear : content offers interactivity to control progress
- non linear content also known as hypermedia content
### Application of multimedia :
- creative industries 
- education 
- scientific and mathematical researches
- commercial
- medicine 
- entertainment & fine arts
- engineering
- industry
- multimedia in public places
### Stages of developing multimedia :
- Planning & costing  -> beginning with idea or need ,  necessary to estimate the time needed to prepare all elements of multimedia and prepare a budget accordingly.
- Designing & producing -> excute each of planning tasks 
- Testing -> ensure the product to be free from bugs
- Delivering -> Final stage 



### Modeling process in 3D animation :
- Polygon modeling
	- create polygon mesh , and used for their flexibility and fast rendering
- Curve modeling
	- used to define surfaces by define these points 
	- Types : (NURBS),splines,patches,geometric Primitives
- Digital sculpting
	- 3D modeling has been more popular in recent years :
	- Types : 
		- Displacement -> use modeling and 32 bit map for vertex position
		- Volumetric -> based on voxels and avoid polygon stretching
		- Dynamic Tessellation -> use triangulation for more smoother surfaces

### Tools for 3D art :
- 3D Modeling
	- representation of a 3D object and display as a 2D image using 3D rendering
- Rigging
	- the control system that enables movement in 3D geometry
- Texture 
	- create surfaces and color attributes and texture artist is responsible for texture models
- Rendering
	- converting 3D wireframe models into 2D images with photorealistic 
	- final step of creating the 2D image
- Animation
	- The art and performance side of 3D animation , create illusion of movement  

- Roung animation add more details and refainment for the poses
- facial animation edit lipsycn and adjust mouth emotions
- cleanup animation adjust keys to be more somoother withou accideent overshot
- final animation handle any special lighting and any rendering issue
- There are 2 techniqes : 
- cel animation : use cel graphics for each frame
- computer animation : use terms like keyframe, layer , and tweening like cel animation 
- varies in how much must be drawn by the animator
