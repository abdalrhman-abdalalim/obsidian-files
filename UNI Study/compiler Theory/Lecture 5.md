### Bottom - up parsing : - 
- also knowns as shift-reduce parsing 
- used to create a parse tree for an input string
- parsing starts from input symbol and create the parse tree up to the start symbol by tracing out the rightmost derivations 
- **Types**
	- Shift reduce 
		- operator precedence 
		- table driven LR parsing
- #### Shift Reduce :-
	- process of reducing a string to the start symbol of a grammar
	- use stack to hold the grammar and an input tape to hold the string
	- in Shift process : current symbol of input string is pushed to a stack
	- in Reduce process : symbol will be replaced by + non-terminal 
	 > Note that : The symbol is the right side of the production and non-terminal is the left side of the production.
	- ##### Operator precedence parsing :-  
		- kind of shift-reduce parsing method 
		- grammar said to be operator precedence when it applies 2 properties : -
			- No product has a∈
			- No 2 non-terminals are adjacent
		-  it occurs only between terminals and ignore non-terminals
		- **Parsing Action :-**
			- for both ends of the give input string add $
				-> Example: For input `id + id * id`, modify it to `$ id + id * id $`.
			- scan string from left to the right until founding >
				-> Example: `$ id ⋗ + id * id $`.
			- scan towards left over all the equal precedence until the first leftmost < founded 
				-> Example: `$ ⋖ id ⋗ + id * id $`.
			- everything between leftmost < and > right most is handled
				-> Example: `$ E + id * id $`.
			- $ on $ means parsing is successful
				-> Example `$ E $`
