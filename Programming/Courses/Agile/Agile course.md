### **Agile vs. Waterfall Approach**

#### **1. Waterfall Model (Traditional Approach)**

The **Waterfall** model is a **sequential** software development methodology. It follows a **linear process**, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

- **Phases in Waterfall:**
    
    1. **Requirement Gathering** – Collecting all project requirements in detail.
    2. **Design** – Creating architecture and system design based on the requirements.
    3. **Implementation (Development)** – Writing the actual code.
    4. **Testing** – Verifying the software for defects.
    5. **Deployment** – Releasing the final product.
    6. **Maintenance** – Fixing issues after deployment.
- **Disadvantages of Waterfall:**
    
    - Changes are **costly** because each phase is dependent on the previous one.
    - No version of the project can be released until the final phase is completed.
    - High **risk** because issues found late in the process can be difficult to fix.
    - Not suitable for projects requiring frequent updates or flexibility.

#### **2. Agile Approach**

**Agile** is a modern, flexible approach that **splits projects into small iterations (sprints)** instead of following a strict sequential process.

- **Agile Principles (from the Agile Manifesto):**
    
    1. **Individuals & interactions** over processes and tools.
    2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
    3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
    4. **Responding to change** over following a fixed plan.
- **How Agile Works:**
    
    - The project is **divided into multiple iterations (sprints)**, each delivering a small, working part of the software.
    - **Continuous feedback** from stakeholders is encouraged.
    - Changes can be made anytime without disrupting the entire project.
    - Teams collaborate closely, ensuring faster and more efficient development.

#### **3. Agile Umbrella & Scrum Framework**

Agile is a broad concept, and **Scrum** is one of the most popular **lightweight** frameworks under the Agile umbrella.

- **Scrum Roles:**
    
    1. **Product Owner** – Defines product vision, manages the backlog, and prioritizes features.
    2. **Scrum Master** – Facilitates the process, removes obstacles, and ensures Agile principles are followed.
    3. **Scrum Team (Developers, Designers, Testers, etc.)** – Works together to deliver working software.
- **Scrum Process:**
    
    - **Sprint Planning** – Defining what will be done in a sprint (usually 1–4 weeks).
    - **Daily Standups** – Short meetings to track progress and obstacles.
    - **Sprint Review & Demo** – Presenting the work done in the sprint.
    - **Sprint Retrospective** – Discussing what went well and what needs improvement.
- **Splitting Work in Scrum:**
    
    - Work is managed using a **product backlog** (list of tasks).
    - The backlog is divided into smaller, **prioritized user stories**.
    - Each sprint delivers a working version of the product.

### **Conclusion**

- **Waterfall** is rigid, making changes costly and delaying releases.
- **Agile** allows for flexibility, customer feedback, and continuous delivery.
- **Scrum** is a popular Agile framework that organizes teams effectively for efficient project execution.
