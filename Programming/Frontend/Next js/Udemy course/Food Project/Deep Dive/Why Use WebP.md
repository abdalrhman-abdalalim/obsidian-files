### **Why Use WebP?**

- **Smaller File Sizes**: WebP compresses images more efficiently than PNG and JPEG, which means faster loading times and better performance, particularly for mobile users.
- **Higher Quality**: WebP offers both **lossy** and **lossless** compression with a better quality-to-file size ratio than PNG/JPEG.
- **Wider Support**: Most modern browsers support WebP, making it a reliable option for a wide audience. However, for browsers that don’t support WebP, you can implement fallback strategies like serving JPEG/PNG images using the `picture` element in HTML.
