## Next.js : 
- Is a React framework
- fullstack react framework
- React is become a hybrid library (improved server-side-rendering | streaming responses | React Server Components | Server Actions)
- Next.js handles route setup & config 
- Next.js handles requests & responses
- Next.js handles data fetching & submission 

---
### **Key features & Benefits**
1) Fullstack apps
2) file-based routing 
	- Routes are configured via the filesystem (folder + files)
	- No code-based configuration or extra packages for routing required
	- Server-side Rendering (by default, Next.JS pre-renders all pages on the server)

**Command to create Next app :-**
-> npx create-next-app@latest

- In Next , actual content is visible , but in react , content is not visible .
- React app is manipulated on the client site in the browser , and this is ==good== because you can edited after it's been loaded , we can update the state of that page without having to fetch a new page , but the ==disadvantage== is that Search engine crawlers don't see the actual page content.
- In Next , you no longer have a client-side application , in this case you have code runs on the server and other runs on client 

#### In Next 
-> page/HTML content is rendered on the server & sent to the client 
#### In React
-> only returns on single HTML file which contains the client-side JS code

### **Two Approaches For Building NextJS Apps**

#### 📄 Pages Router

- Has been around for many years
- Very stable
- Used in many existing Next.js projects
- Allows you to build feature-rich fullstack apps with React

#### 🔷 App Router

- Introduced with Next.js 13
- Marked as stable but still relatively new & partially buggy
- Supports modern Next.js & React features (→ fullstack React apps)
- The future of Next.js
