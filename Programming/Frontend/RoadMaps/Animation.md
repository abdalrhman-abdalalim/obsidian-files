### **Day 1: Core Animation Fundamentals**

- **Learn CSS Animations:**
    
    - Study `transition`, `transform`, and `keyframes`.
    - Experiment with easing functions (`ease-in-out`, `ease`, `linear`).
    - Practice:
        - Create hover effects for buttons and links.
        - Build a bouncing ball animation using `keyframes`.
    - Resources: [MDN CSS Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation).
- **Learn JavaScript Animations:**
    
    - Understand how `requestAnimationFrame` works.
    - Manipulate simple DOM elements for animations like sliding or fading.
    - Practice: Build a carousel/slider.

### **Day 2: Advanced CSS and Libraries**

- **SVG Animations:**
    
    - Learn `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` for line-drawing effects.
    - Practice: Animate an SVG logo or icon.
- **Animation Libraries:**
    
    - Explore **GSAP**:
        - Learn `TweenLite` and `Timeline` basics.
        - Practice chaining animations for advanced control.
    - Framer Motion (if using React):
        - Learn `AnimatePresence` and `variants`.
        - Practice animating React components (e.g., modals, cards).

---

### **Day 3: Motion Principles and Performance**

- **Understand Motion Design Principles:**
    
    - Study easing curves, timing, and spacing.
    - Learn basic physics-based motion (spring and bounce).
- **Optimize Performance:**
    
    - Focus on animating `transform` and `opacity` for GPU acceleration.
    - Use `will-change` to optimize animations.
    - Use browser DevTools to inspect and debug animations.
- **Practice:**
    
    - Build a "loading spinner" with CSS.
    - Create a scroll-based fade-in effect using GSAP or Intersection Observer API.

---

### **Day 4: Page Transitions and Interactivity**

- **Page Transitions:**
    
    - Use Framer Motion or GSAP to create smooth transitions between pages in React or Next.js.
    - Practice animating layout changes with `AnimateSharedLayout`.
- **Interactive Animations:**
    
    - Add hover, click, and scroll-triggered animations to a small project (e.g., a portfolio section).

---

### **Day 5: 3D and Canvas Animations**

- **3D Animations:**
    
    - Learn CSS 3D transforms (`rotateX`, `rotateY`, `perspective`).
    - Practice creating a rotating card or cube.
- **Canvas and SVG Animations:**
    
    - Dive into HTML5 `<canvas>` for drawing and animating shapes.
    - Practice: Build a bouncing ball or particle system.
- **Optional:** Start with **Three.js** for basic 3D scenes (e.g., spinning globe).
    

---

### **Day 6: Real-World Projects**

- **Build a Mini-Portfolio:**
    
    - Include:
        - A hero section with smooth text/image transitions.
        - Animated navigation (hover effects, dropdowns).
        - SVG animations (e.g., logo or icons).
- **Polish Interactive Components:**
    
    - Add scroll-triggered animations using GSAP or Intersection Observer.
    - Implement a custom loader using Lottie.

---

### **Day 7: Review and Deploy**

- **Polish and Review:**
    
    - Test animations for performance and responsiveness.
    - Debug any glitches using browser DevTools.
- **Deploy:**
    
    - Publish your project on **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
    - Share on **CodePen** or **Dribbble** to showcase your work.
- **Learn from Feedback:**
    
    - Ask peers or online communities for constructive feedback.
