### **Day 1: React Core Concepts**

- **React Basics:**
    - Review JSX, components, props, and state.
    - Understand lifecycle methods with React Hooks:
        - `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useReducer`.
- **Component Patterns:**
    - Functional vs. class components (just for understanding legacy code).
    - Higher-order components (HOCs) and render props.
    - Modern patterns: Composition, Context API, and custom hooks.
- **Practice:**
    - Refactor an old React project or create a simple CRUD app with hooks.

### **Day 2: Advanced React**

- **State Management:**
    - Review Context API for global state management.
    - Understand lifting state up and prop drilling.
- **Performance Optimization:**
    - Memoization with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.
    - Lazy loading with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
- **React Router:**
    - Dynamic routes, nested routes, and route-based code splitting.
    - Review hooks like `useNavigate` and `useParams`.
- **Practice:**
    - Optimize a React project by using memoization and lazy loading.

---

### **Day 3: Redux Basics**

- **Core Redux Concepts:**
    - Actions, reducers, and the store.
    - State immutability and pure functions.
- **Redux Toolkit:**
    - Understand `configureStore`, `createSlice`, and `createAction`.
    - Explore built-in middleware like `thunk` and `redux-logger`.
- **Best Practices:**
    - Split state slices into features/modules.
    - Use selectors for derived state.
- **Practice:**
    - Create a simple counter app with Redux Toolkit.

---

### **Day 4: Advanced Redux Toolkit**

- **RTK Query Introduction:**
    - Understand `createApi` and `fetchBaseQuery`.
    - Define endpoints and use hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`).
- **RTK Query Features:**
    - Data caching, invalidation, and re-fetching.
    - Handling optimistic updates with `onQueryStarted`.
- **Middleware and Customization:**
    - Add custom middleware to handle logging or error reporting.
    - Practice combining Redux Toolkit slices with RTK Query.
- **Practice:**
    - Build a simple app (e.g., a blog) with RTK Query for API calls.

---

### **Day 5: Ecosystem and Advanced Use Cases**

- **React-Redux Integration:**
    - Review `Provider` and `connect` (for understanding legacy code).
    - Use `useSelector` and `useDispatch` with hooks.
- **Middleware and Async Actions:**
    - Understand how Redux middleware works.
    - Practice handling async actions with `createAsyncThunk` and `extraReducers`.
- **RTK Query Advanced:**
    - Customizing base queries for different API structures.
    - Handling file uploads or WebSocket-based APIs.
- **Practice:**
    - Extend the blog app to include authentication and optimistic updates.

---

### **Day 6: Testing and Debugging**

- **Testing React Components:**
    - Use **React Testing Library** for unit and integration tests.
    - Mock API calls with libraries like `msw`.
- **Testing Redux and RTK Query:**
    - Test slices and reducers independently.
    - Test async actions and API calls with mocked services.
- **Debugging Tools:**
    - Redux DevTools for state inspection.
    - Browser DevTools for performance and network debugging.
- **Practice:**
    - Write tests for key features in your projects.

---

### **Day 7: Review and Project Practice**

- **Review Core Concepts:**
    - Revisit React hooks, Redux patterns, and RTK Query APIs.
    - Write short notes on key concepts or create a cheatsheet.
- **Build a Mini Project:**
    - Build a full-stack app with CRUD operations using:
        - React for the frontend.
        - Redux Toolkit for state management.
        - RTK Query for API calls.
- **Deploy and Share:**
    - Deploy your app on Vercel/Netlify.
    - Share it on GitHub for feedback.
