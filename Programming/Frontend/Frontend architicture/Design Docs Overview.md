Informal documents describing your solution to a problem.  
Used to **share** with stakeholders and team → get **feedback** before implementation.

Two levels:

- **High-Level Design Doc** → Describes _entire architecture_ or big-picture solution.
    
- **Low-Level Design Doc** → Describes _how to implement_ a specific feature.

### **When to Use**

- **High-Level**: Architecture, system-wide changes, broad context.
    
- **Low-Level**: Detailed feature planning, pseudocode, mock APIs/data types.

### **Suggested Structure**

_(If your company doesn’t have a template)_

1. **Overview**
    
    - 1–2 paragraphs summarizing the problem and proposed solution.
        
2. **Context**
    
    - Background info needed to understand the document.
        
    - May include **system context diagrams**.
        
3. **Goals and Non-Goals**
    
    - What’s in scope vs. out of scope.
        
4. **High-Level Design** _(for high-level docs)_
    
    - **Container diagram** or other architectural visuals.
        
    - Describe architecture using the _4 dimensions_ (from earlier in the course).
        
    - Key components/modules and their roles.
        
5. **Alternatives Considered**
    
    - Frameworks, libraries, or tech you _didn’t choose_, and why.
        
6. **Detailed Design** _(for low-level docs)_
    
    - Pseudocode, low-level diagrams, mock data types/APIs.
        
7. **Timeline**
    
    - Best guess estimate for completion (even if rough).
        
8. **Risks and Open Questions**
    
    - Potential blockers or uncertainties.
        
9. **Appendix**
    
    - Links to relevant docs (requirements, domain models, etc.).

### **Tips**

- **Keep it short** → More likely to be read.
    
- Use diagrams (flowcharts, container diagrams, sequence diagrams) where helpful.
    
- Remember: goal is _clarity + feedback_, not exhaustive documentation.
